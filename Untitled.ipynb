    "# Movie Industry Analysis for Microsoft\n",

    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to help Microsoft better understand movie industry and figure out what kind of movies are doing the best currently in world. Using this analysis Microsoft can build up a strategy for creating their own movies that will definetly hit the top. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through this analysis, I will show some interesting trends in the data pertaining to what successful movies have in common. This analysis will mainly be done through the examination of provided datasets. \n",

    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to better understand the movie industry and find out what kind of movies Microsoft should produce to get the most of it, I analyzed the data sources and formulated 4 questions that Microsoft should consider before making the decision to enter movie industry and start filming:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What genres are the most popular and giving the most profit?\n",
    "* Is there a correlation between the average ratings and the runtime of the movie?\n",
    "* Is there a correlation between movie's release date and gross profit?\n",
    "* What are the Top 10 succesfull studios and what are their content ratings focus?\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions will provide Microsoft valuable insight on which genres it should focus on to increase its likelihood of generating high gross sales. Does it need to consider the runtime of the movie when filming, what is the best time to release the movie for higher profit and what movie content it should focus on.\n",
    "\n",

    "* **The most proftable months for movie release** are  May, June, July and November. Microsoft would hit highest ROI during these months. Also, it is recomended to avoid releaing in April, September, October and December, considering the fact that profits arew low during these times and December has the highest amount of releases. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **When choosing the content rating**, it would be suggested to choose the most popular one, such that \"R\". Because it would have high chances to get interest of audience. Or choose the least produced one as a niche, which might be less competative. \n",
